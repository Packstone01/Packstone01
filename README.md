Hello, my name is Packstone01!
I’m interested in learning to code so that I can pursue a career in the IT field.
I’m currently learning the basics of Github but soon will be moving on to Java.

If you want to collaborate on a project or ask any questions regarding code you can email me at connor.schotz@gmail.com!
